# Elevator-FSM-Project
The Elevator FSM Project is a digital simulation of a 4-floor elevator (lift) controller implemented in SystemVerilog. The project models a real-world lift that can move up and down, respond to floor requests from passengers, and efficiently serve multiple simultaneous requests.
